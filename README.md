# Horiseon Web App
Module 1 Challenge

- This challege was used to practice consolidation of repetitive code, as well as adding more accessibility. It helped me learn how to efficiently code to save myself from being overwhelmed if/when I ever need make changes to my site; as well as how the <alt> attribute assists with accessibility.
- I was also able to double check links to make sure they were working properly and left extra comments/notes in the CSS file.
